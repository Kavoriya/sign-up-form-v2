# sign-up-form-v2

In this project I will create a sign-up form.
This form asks user to fill out
-name
-email
-password (twice).
-checkbox

Input fields have labels inside, which relocate to the top of the field when user
clicks on them.
There is form validation using colors and error messages.
Custom checkbox.
